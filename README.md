# Amazon Tetris Game

A modern, responsive Tetris game built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, featuring Amazon-inspired styling and colors.

## Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: All standard Tetris pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- **Amazon-Themed Design**: Beautiful color scheme inspired by Amazon's brand colors
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your high score
- **Next Piece Preview**: See what piece is coming next
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid piece movement and line clearing effects
- **Game Over Screen**: Restart functionality when the game ends

## Game Pieces

The game includes all seven standard Tetris pieces:

- **I-Piece** (Orange): Straight line piece - great for clearing multiple lines
- **O-Piece** (Gold): Square piece - stable and easy to place
- **T-Piece** (Sky Blue): T-shaped piece - versatile for filling gaps
- **S-Piece** (Light Green): S-shaped piece - good for creating steps
- **Z-Piece** (Light Red): Z-shaped piece - mirror of S-piece
- **J-Piece** (Purple): J-shaped piece - useful for corners
- **L-Piece** (Orange): L-shaped piece - mirror of J-piece

## Controls

The game supports two different control schemes for maximum flexibility:

### Arrow Keys (Traditional)
- **‚Üê / ‚Üí** (Left/Right Arrow): Move piece horizontally
- **‚Üì** (Down Arrow): Soft drop (move piece down faster)
- **‚Üë** (Up Arrow): Rotate piece clockwise

### WASD + R (Alternative)
- **A / D**: Move piece left/right
- **S**: Soft drop (move piece down faster)
- **R**: Rotate piece clockwise

### Universal Controls
- **Space**: Hard drop (instantly drop piece to bottom)

Both control schemes work simultaneously, so you can use whichever feels more comfortable or switch between them during gameplay. The soft drop controls (‚Üì and S) make pieces fall faster than the normal drop speed, allowing for more precise placement.

## Scoring System

- **Single Line**: 100 points
- **Double Line**: 400 points (100 √ó 2 √ó 2)
- **Triple Line**: 900 points (100 √ó 3 √ó 3)
- **Tetris (4 lines)**: 1600 points (100 √ó 4 √ó 4)

The game speed increases slightly each time you clear lines, making it progressively more challenging.
